## About my App
In my childhood, I developed an interest in mathematics by learning in a fun way, which engaged me in the subject and made me feel confident to continue learning. Through cartoons, I absorbed concepts such as fractions, geometry and negative numbers. Taking part in competitions organized by my teachers also gave me practice in the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

When thinking about participating in WWDC, my goal was to create an engaging experience to help children improve their mental calculation. This skill not only boosts the development of logical-mathematical reasoning, but also strengthens concentration, memory and problem-solving skills. Thus came about the Footmath app, designed to allow children to practice mental calculation in a fun context of soccer and an intergalactic tournament.

The design of the app was created by me in pixel art, incorporating vibrant colors to provide an attractive aesthetic. In addition, I chose to implement ARKit to offer a more immersive experience, captivating the user's attention even more. The combination of these elements makes practicing math a fun and entertaining journey, encouraging learning in a creative and engaging way.

##Features and technologies I used
While developing the app, SwiftUI was used to create the onboarding experience, facilitating navigation between the different screens and implement essential elements of the user interface, such as the timer and scoreboard, on the augmented reality screen. In addition, augmented reality technology (Reality Kit) was employed to create crucial gameplay elements, including the goal, the ball and the shooting areas, providing an immersive and interactive experience. As far as audio playback is concerned, AVKit was chosen. For communication between the SwiftUI and RealityKit interfaces, ARKit was used, allowing efficient integration and fluid synchronization between the user interface elements and the augmented reality elements.
